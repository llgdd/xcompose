# xcompose
One .XCompose to rule them all.

## How to use
Clone this repo and enter the directory you clone it into:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/llgdd/xcompose && cd xcompose
```

Copy `.XCompose` to your home directory every time thereʼs an update:
```bash
cp .XCompose $HOME/
```

Alternatively, symlink it there just this once:
```bash
ln -s $PWD/.XCompose $HOME/.XCompose
```

Enable Compose in your systemʼs settings and assign it to a desirable key.
You can usually find Compose-related tweaks in your desktop environmentʼs keyboard settings.

Log out and log back in.

If you find out some problem like some combinations do not work then change input method, like [xim](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/166954/223806) or [ibus](https://desktopi18n.wordpress.com/2019/10/17/ibus-1-5-21-is-released/).

Voilà!
