# xcompose
One .XCompose to rule them all.

## How to use
Clone this repo and enter the directory you clone it into:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/llgdd/xcompose && cd xcompose
```

Copy `.XCompose` to your home directory every time thereʼs an update:
```bash
cp .XCompose $HOME/
```

Alternatively, symlink it there just this once:
```bash
ln -s $PWD/.XCompose $HOME/.XCompose
```

Enable Compose in your systemʼs settings and assign it to a desirable key.
You can usually find Compose-related tweaks in your desktop environmentʼs keyboard settings.

Log out and log back in.

Voilà!
