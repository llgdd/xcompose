# xcompose
One .XCompose to rule them all.

### How to use
Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/llgdd/xcompose
```

Enter to the folder of repro:
```bash
cd xcompose
```

And copy `.XCompose` each time after update over to your home directory:
```bash
cp .XCompose ~/
```

Or create once link there:
```bash
ln -s $PWD/.XCompose ~/.XCompose
```

Enable Compose in your systemʼs settings and assign it to a desirable key.
You can usually find Compose-related tweaks in your desktop environmentʼs keyboard settings.

Log out and log back in.

Voilà!
